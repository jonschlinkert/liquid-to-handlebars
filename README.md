## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save liquid-to-handlebars
```

## Why use this?

If you've ever seen a jekyll boilerplate, or another project that uses [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) templates and wished it was written in [handlebars](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/), this is your solution!

* 100% of the tags mentioned in the [shopify liquid documentation](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) convert to handlebars syntax
* easily migrate any liquid theme or boilerplate
* use more powerful and flexible handlebars helpers instead of liquid filters

**Please [create an issue](../../issues/new) if you find a tag that doesn't convert correctly, and I'll add support. Thanks!**

## Usage

```js
const converter = require('liquid-to-handlebars');
// Converts this liquid
console.log(converter.convert('Price: ${{ product_price | default: 2.99 }}'));
// To this handlebars
//=> 'Price: ${{default product_price 2.99}}'
```

You will also need to include any missing handlebars helpers that provide similar functionality to the liquid filters that are being replaced. For example:

```js
const handlebars = require('handlebars');
handlebars.registerHelper('default', function(a, b) {
  return a || b || '';
});

const fn = handlebars.compile('Price: ${{default product_price 2.99}}');
console.log(fn());
//=> 'Price: $2.99'

console.log(fn({default_price: '4.99'}));
//=> 'Price: $4.99'
```

## Migration debugging

_Once your liquid templates are converted to handlebars, if you attempt to render all of the templates with handlebars without any additional work, it's a good bet that you'll receive a bunch of errors from missing helpers._

Save yourself a bunch of time and frustration by following these steps:

### Step 1: Add starter helpers

Add the following to your app:

```js
const handlebars = require('handlebars');

// override handlebars' built-in `helperMissing` helper, so that we 
// can easily see which helpers are missing and get them fixed
handlebars.registerHelper('helperMissing', function() {
  const opts = [].slice.call(arguments).pop();
  console.log(`missing helper {{${opts.name}}}`);
});
```

### Step 2: Run handlebars

Now, when you run handlebars, if you see a message like this:

```js
missing helper {{foo}}
```

You can either create the `foo` helper from scratch, or use a helper library that already includes the helpers you need.

Any of the following libraries may be used, but the [liquid-filters][] library might be most useful (during migration, at least).

* [liquid-filters][] - includes a bunch of utility javascript functions that can be registered as handlebars helpers to provide parity with the built-in liquid filters
* [template-helpers](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/template-helpers) - generic helpers that can be used with any template engine.
* [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers) - more than 150 handlebars helpers

**Examples**

```js
const handlebars = require('handlebars');
const filters = require('liquid-filters');
const helpers = require('template-helpers');

handlebars.registerHelper(filters());
handlebars.registerHelper(helpers());
```

## Conversion Examples

There are **many more examples** in the [docs folder](./examples.md), as well as [test/fixtures](./test/fixtures) and [test/expected](test/expected).

### Conditionals

**basic operators**

From this liquid:

```liquid
{% if product.type == "Shirt" or product.type == "Shoes" %}
  This is a shirt or a pair of shoes.
{% endif %}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
{{#if (or (is product.type "Shirt") (is product.type "Shoes"))}}
  This is a shirt or a pair of shoes.
{{/if}}
```

**boolean**

From this liquid:

```liquid
{% if settings.fp_heading %}
  <h1>{{ settings.fp_heading }}</h1>
{% endif %}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
{{#if settings.fp_heading}}
  <h1>{{ settings.fp_heading }}</h1>
{{/if}}
```

**case**

From this liquid:

```liquid
{% case handle %}
{% when 'cake' %}
  This is a cake
{% when 'cookie' %}
  This is a cookie
{% else %}
  This is not a cookie/cake
{% endcase %}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
{{#is handle 'cake'}}
  This is a cake
{{else is handle 'cookie'}}
  This is a cookie
{{ else }}
  This is not a cookie/cake
{{/is}}
```

Requires the ["is" helper](https://github.com/nimojs/handlebars-helper-is).

**else**

From this liquid:

```liquid
{% if username and username.size > 10 %}
  Wow, {{ username }}, you have a long name!
{% else %}
  Hello there!
{% endif %}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
{{#if (and username (gt username.size 10))}}
  Wow, {{ username }}, you have a long name!
{{else}}
  Hello there!
{{/if}}
```

**contains**

From this liquid:

```liquid
{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}
  This product's title contains the word Pack.
{% endif %}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
{{#if (contains product.title "Pack")}}
  This product's title contains the word Pack.
{{/if}}
```

### Arrays

**Basic loops**

From this liquid:

```liquid
<!-- if site.users = "Tobi", "Laura", "Tetsuro", "Adam" -->
{% for user in site.users %}
  {{ user }}
{% endfor %}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
<!-- if site.users = "Tobi", "Laura", "Tetsuro", "Adam" -->
{{#each site.users as |user|}}
  {{ user }}
{{/each}}
```

**Accessing specific items in arrays**

From this liquid:

```liquid
<!-- if site.users = "Tobi", "Laura", "Tetsuro", "Adam" -->
{{ site.users[0] }}
{{ site.users[1] }}
{{ site.users[3] }}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
<!-- if site.users = "Tobi", "Laura", "Tetsuro", "Adam" -->
{{get site.users 0}}
{{get site.users 1}}
{{get site.users 3}}
```

### Filters

> Filters are converted to [handlebars subexpressions](http://handlebarsjs.com/expressions.html#subexpressions)

From this liquid:

```liquid
{{ "Ground control to Major Tom." | split: "" | reverse | join: "" }}
```

To this handlebars:

```handlebars
{{join (reverse (split "Ground control to Major Tom." "")) ""}}
```

**Many more examples** in the [docs folder](docs) and [unit tests](test).
